        <h1>Authentication</h1>
        <p>
            For this component try to somehow use slots to pass in the different titles,
            headers and descriptions. Also, use a router view to selectively render the different
            components between login and sign up which has been set up in router.js.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pay close
            attention to the sign up button in the login component. This should use router.go to
            switch to 'authentication/signup'
        </p>
